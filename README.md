# Error-Analysis
Analyze model performance with ease! This notebook dives deep into train and test losses across groups, pinpointing hard-to-predict segments for targeted improvements

This notebook is designed to facilitate detailed error analysis by evaluating model performance across different groups within the dataset. By examining train and test losses within these groups, we can identify patterns in model behavior, uncovering insights such as which groups are more challenging to predict or have higher error rates. Such analysis allows for targeted model improvements, focusing on the groups with the most significant errors or underperformance. This approach not only enhances the modelâ€™s robustness but also ensures a more balanced performance across all data segments, critical for models deployed in real-world scenarios with diverse data distributions.

Whether you're optimizing model accuracy or identifying bias, this notebook provides a structured way to pinpoint specific groups that may need further refinement, ultimately leading to better, more inclusive models.
